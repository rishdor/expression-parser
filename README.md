# Expression Parser

## Overview
Expression Parser is a Java application that parses mathematical expressions and evaluates them. The parser supports the basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (^). It also supports parentheses to control the order of operations (PEMDAS).

## Features
- Parses and evaluates mathematical expressions
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, and ^
- Supports parentheses to control the order of operations
- Checks for balanced parentheses in the expression
- Throws exceptions for invalid expressions
  
## Testing
The project includes a suite of unit tests to verify the correctness of the parser. The tests cover various scenarios and edge cases, including invalid expressions and division by zero.
